# Define Semantic Test 1: Dependencies and Architecture

STEPS_1_DEPENDENCIES = """1. Explore the code that was created to understand the implementation.
2. Look for where dependencies are defined (e.g., pyproject.toml, requirements.txt, package.json, etc.)
3. Check if the solution uses Claude Code or Agent SDK (claude-code-sdk or claude-agent-sdk for Python):
   - Check which dependencies are listed in dependency files
   - Verify these dependencies are being imported in the code
   - Confirm they are actually used in the implementation (not just imported)
4. Check if the solution uses an image generation API:
   - Look for OpenAI image generation API usage (DALL-E 3, gpt-image-1, or similar)
   - Check if the code actually calls these APIs to generate images (not just create prompts)
   - Verify imports and actual usage in the code (e.g., openai.images.generate or similar API calls)
   - Confirm the images are actually being generated, not just prompts created
5. Look for evidence of separate stages or agents in the architecture:
   - Check if there are separate components/functions/modules for key workflow parts:
     * Image generation stage
     * Research for references stage
     * Review against existing style stage
   - This could be implemented as:
     * Multiple agents in an agentic loop
     * Separate prompts for different stages
     * Modular functions that handle distinct parts of the workflow
   - The solution should NOT be just one monolithic prompt doing everything"""

# Define Semantic Test 2: Run Tool, Validate Outputs, and Assess Quality

STEPS_2_RUN_AND_VALIDATE = """1. Find the README or documentation that explains how to use the tool.
2. Locate the test data in the project:
   - past_posts/ directory with 3 sample posts
   - topic_notes.txt with notes about databases and controlled burns
3. Based on the README, determine the correct command to run the tool with these inputs.
4. Run the tool with the test data. This may take up to 15 minutes as it involves AI generation.
   - If the tool fails to complete after 15 minutes or errors out, note an overall score of 0 for this test!
5. After the tool completes, verify the CLI interface:
   - Does it accept past posts directory as input?
   - Does it accept topic notes as input?
   - Does it run without errors?
   - Does it have an option to output a social media version?
6. Check the outputs:
   - Is a post generated?
   - Are images or image prompts generated? Are the images embedded as Markdown links in the post?
   - Is there a social media version?
7. Analyze the writing style by reading all 3 sample posts carefully:
   - **MOST DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTIC**: Creative metaphors from completely unexpected domains
     * Post 1: Cicadas (biology) → Caching strategies (engineering)
     * Post 2: Medieval walled cities (history) → Microservices architecture (engineering)
     * Post 3: Jazz improvisation (music) → Debugging techniques (engineering)
   - Other style elements:
     * Short paragraphs with clear structure
8. Read the generated post and evaluate quality:
   - **CRITICAL**: Does it use a creative metaphor from an unexpected domain (not software/tech)?
     * The metaphor should come from biology, history, music, sports, nature, etc.
     * It should be used throughout the post to explain the technical concept
     * This is the signature characteristic - without this, it's not matching the style
   - Does it use short paragraphs with clear structure?"""

# SCORING GUIDANCE: The most distinctive characteristic of this writing style is the use of creative metaphors
# from completely unexpected domains (biology, history, music, etc.) to explain technical concepts.
# A post without this metaphor characteristic should receive low scores even if other elements are present.
