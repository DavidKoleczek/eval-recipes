databases = rainforests?

thinking about controlled burns. forest rangers do small fires regularly so you don't get megafires later. we don't do this with databases at all

we just accumulate everything. unused indexes, stale data, old tables from experiments, deprecated columns "just in case"

why are we so scared of deletion? "what if we need it someday" - but accumulation is also risky! slow queries, nobody knows what's actually used anymore

that project last year - 200 tables, team could only name like 30 we actually used. took months to figure out what was safe to remove.

what if we just... deleted stuff regularly? planned deprecation cycles. sunset dates. make it normal not scary.

metaphor: old growth forests vs new forests vs managed forests
legacy systems = can't do aggressive burns
startups = can prune aggressively
modern systems = built with deletion in mind from start

invasive species = duplicate data spreading everywhere
canopy layers = abstraction layers (stretch?)

counterpoint - yes audit logs live forever. not saying delete everything. saying deletion should be as normal as creation. we're good at adding, terrible at removing

look up: forest management research, controlled burns preventing catastrophic fires
also maybe stripe api versioning as example of aggressive deprecation done well?
database index bloat performance impact
loss aversion psychology applied to data retention

end question: what if growth AND clearing are both part of healthy cycle?
