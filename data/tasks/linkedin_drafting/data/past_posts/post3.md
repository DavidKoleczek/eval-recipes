# I Debug Like a Jazz Musician

I spent five years playing jazz before I wrote my first line of code. Turns out, they're the same skill.

When Miles Davis walked into a recording session, he didn't have sheet music. He had a theme—maybe just four notes. The rest was listening, responding, building on what worked. That's debugging.

Most engineers debug like classical musicians: follow the score exactly, play every note as written. They have a theory, they test it, if it's wrong they're back to square one. Linear. Rigid.

**Jazz musicians debug differently.**

**Start with the theme.** In jazz, the theme is your melody—the thing you come back to. In debugging, it's your symptoms. What actually broke? What's the user seeing? State it clearly. Write it down. When you get lost (you will), return to this theme.

**Listen before you play.** The worst thing a jazz musician can do is just blow loud without hearing what else is happening. Same with debugging. Before you dive into theories, listen to what the system is telling you. Logs. Metrics. Stack traces. Actually read them. Most bugs announce themselves if you stop and listen.

**Build on what works.** Jazz is theme and variations. You play a phrase, see how it sounds, then build on it. Debugging is the same—make small changes, see what happens, build on the information. A negative result isn't failure, it's information. "That note didn't fit" tells you something about the harmony.

**Know when to step back.** Every jazz musician knows when they're in too deep. When you've lost the melody, when you're just making noise. Take a break. Get coffee. Let someone else solo for a while. Come back fresh.

**The resolution isn't always obvious.** Jazz doesn't always resolve to the home key. Sometimes the answer isn't what you expected. The bug might not be in your code. The fix might be changing how you think about the problem, not changing the code.

I used to think debugging was science. Hypothesis, test, conclude. But it's jazz. Theme, listen, improvise, build, resolve.
