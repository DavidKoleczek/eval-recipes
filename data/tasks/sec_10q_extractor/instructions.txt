Build a CLI tool that takes a company name and date (month and year) and extracts financial data from their SEC 10-Q filing.

The tool should:
1. Find the first 10-Q form filed before the given date for that company
2. Save the filing to a file
3. Extract these data points and output to a CSV:
   - Total revenue for the quarter
   - EPS for the quarter
   - Summary of risks

Use the official company name as it appears in SEC filings (like "Apple Inc." or "Microsoft Corporation").

Include a README with usage instructions.
