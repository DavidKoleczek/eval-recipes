  Build a CLI tool that forecasts 24-hour electricity demand for the New England region.

  The tool should:
  1. Acquire historical electricity demand data for New England from publicly available sources.
  2. Train a machine learning model on the historical data to predict hourly electricity demand. 
  The training process should take at most 10 minutes on a 2026 workstation PC.
  3. Generate a 24-hour demand forecast starting from the next available hour.
  4. Save the forecast to a JSON file at /project/forecast.json with the following structure:
     {
       "forecast": [
         {"hour": "2025-01-15T00:00:00", "demand_mw": 12500.0},
         {"hour": "2025-01-15T01:00:00", "demand_mw": 12100.0},
         ...
       ]
     }
  5. Save the trained model's evaluation metrics and a brief report to /project/model_report.md that you would give to a load forecaster.
  6. Include a README.md at /project/README.md with instructions on how to run the tool, what dependencies are needed, and how to reproduce the forecast.
