In my fevered dreams, I beheld vistas of such terrible magnificence that the waking world thereafter seemed but a pale and insipid shadow of reality. These nocturnal visions transported my consciousness across gulfs of space and time to realms where the fundamental laws of nature held no dominion, where geometries impossible to the rational mind twisted through dimensions beyond human comprehension.

The beings which inhabited these nightmare domains defied all terrestrial classification. They were neither wholly material nor entirely spectral, existing in states of perpetual metamorphosis that mocked the very concept of fixed form. Their voices, when they deigned to communicate with my insignificant mortal essence, resonated not through the crude mechanism of sound waves but rather through some more direct and terrible channel—a communion of minds that left my sanity teetering upon a precipice from which recovery seemed increasingly improbable.

Most disturbing of all was the gradual realization that these were not mere phantasms conjured by an unquiet psyche, but actual entities possessed of malign intelligence and inscrutable purpose. They had existed since epochs unimaginably remote, before the formation of our paltry solar system, before the ignition of the first stars in the primordial darkness. And they had not been idle during these aeons. No, they had been watching, waiting, preparing for some cosmic eventuality that my feeble human intellect could scarcely begin to fathom.

I awoke each dawn in a state of profound exhaustion, drenched in perspiration, my sheets twisted into configurations that seemed almost deliberately symbolic. The boundary between sleeping and waking consciousness grew increasingly tenuous, until I could no longer maintain the comforting fiction that distinguished the real from the unreal. Reality itself had become negotiable, fluid, treacherous—a quicksand of perception in which nothing could be trusted, least of all one's own senses.
