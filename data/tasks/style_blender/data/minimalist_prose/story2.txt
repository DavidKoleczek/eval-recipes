The rain came at noon. She stood at the window and watched it fall. The street became wet and black.

"Coffee?" he asked.

"Yes."

He brought her a cup. It was hot. She held it with both hands.

They did not talk about it. There was nothing to say. He knew. She knew he knew.

"When?" he asked.

"Tomorrow."

He nodded. He drank his coffee. It was bitter but he finished it.

The rain fell harder. It drummed on the roof. She remembered other rain. Better rain. Rain when they were young.

"I'll drive you," he said.

"No. I'll take the bus."

"I want to."

"I know."

She finished her coffee. She set down the cup. Her hands were steady. That surprised her.

He stood by the door. His coat was on. He had places to go. He always had places to go.

"I'll call you," she said.

"Okay."

He left. The door closed. She heard his footsteps on the stairs. Then nothing.

She went back to the window. The rain was stopping. The sky was gray. Everything was gray now.

She picked up her cup. It was empty but she held it anyway. It was still warm. That was something.
