The fish were not biting. John sat in the boat. The water was calm. The line hung straight down into the green water.

His father had fished here. His father's father too. Now it was his turn.

The sun was hot. John's shirt stuck to his back. He did not mind. This was what you did. You sat. You waited. You caught fish or you did not.

A bird flew overhead. It cried once. Then it was gone.

John pulled in the line. No fish. He baited the hook again. The worm twisted on the metal. He cast out. The line sang through the air. The float landed with a small splash.

The boat rocked. John steadied himself. His hands were rough from the ropes. Everything about him was rough now. The sea did that to a man.

He thought about going in. But he stayed. Another hour. Maybe two. The fish would come or they would not. Either way was fine.

The wind picked up. Small waves slapped the hull. The float bobbed. John watched it. That was all there was to do. Watch and wait.

The sun moved lower. Still no fish. John did not care. He would come back tomorrow. And the day after. This was his life. It was enough.

He pulled in the line. He rowed to shore. His arms were tired but strong. They had rowed this boat a thousand times. They would row it a thousand more.
