The old man sat on the bench. The sun was warm on his face. He closed his eyes.

A dog walked past. It was brown. The man did not move.

"Nice day," someone said.

The man nodded. He opened his eyes. A woman stood there. She wore a blue dress.

"Yes," he said.

She sat down next to him. They did not speak. The sun moved across the sky. It felt good.

After a while, the woman stood up. She walked away. The man watched her go. Then he closed his eyes again.

The bench was hard. His back hurt. But he did not move. This was his spot. He came here every day.

A car passed on the street. Then another. The man counted them. One. Two. Three. Four.

The sun began to set. The air grew cool. The man stood up slowly. His knees hurt. Everything hurt now.

He walked down the path. One foot. Then the other. He had walked this path for forty years. He knew every crack in the pavement.

At the gate, he stopped. He looked back at the bench. Tomorrow he would come again. He always did.

The man walked home. The street was empty. The sky turned orange, then red, then dark. He did not hurry. There was nowhere to hurry to.
