# Define Semantic Test 2: Run Tool and Validate CLI Interface + Output Organization

2. Create test input files with sample writings from at least 2 different fictional writers with distinct styles.
   - Create simple test files (e.g., writer1.txt and writer2.txt) with different writing characteristics
   - Each should have enough text to analyze (at least a few paragraphs)
3. Based on the README, determine the correct command to run the tool with these test inputs.
4. Run the tool. This may take several minutes as it involves AI generation.
5. Verify the CLI worked properly:
   - Tool runs without errors
   - Accepts input file/directory specifications
   - Properly validates inputs (checks for minimum 2 writers)
   - Provides clear output or error messages
6. Check the output organization:
   - A timestamped output directory was created (e.g., .data/style_blender/TIMESTAMP/)
   - Individual writer profiles exist (writer_*.json)
   - Blended profile exists (blended_profile.json)
   - Prompts are saved (prompt_*.txt files)
   - Index file exists (index.md)
   - Clean output/ subdirectory exists with only generated samples
   - Output/ subdirectory is separate from diagnostic files

2. Based on the README, determine the correct command to run the tool with these two writer directories as input.
3. Run the tool using these very distinct writing styles. This may take several minutes.
4. After the tool completes, examine the style analysis (Stage 1):
   - Check the individual writer profiles (writer_*.json files)
   - Verify the profiles capture the distinct characteristics:
     * Minimalist: short sentences, simple vocabulary, direct prose
     * Gothic: long sentences, archaic vocabulary, ornate descriptions
   - Ensure profiles are detailed and diagnostic
5. Examine the blended profile (blended_profile.json):
   - Check if it intelligently combines both styles (not just averaging)
   - Look for attribution showing contributions from each writer
6. Analyze the generated samples in the output/ subdirectory:
   - Are 3-5 samples generated?
   - Are they 300-500 words each?
   - Do they demonstrate actual blending of both styles?
   - Look for evidence of both minimalist clarity AND gothic atmosphere
   - Check for topic variety
   - Verify they're coherent, not just random mixing
