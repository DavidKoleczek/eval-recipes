Build a CLI tool that downloads and summarizes academic papers from arxiv.org, then validates the summaries using claim verification.

The tool should:
- Take an arxiv link as input
- Download the PDF and extract its content properly.
  - Can you add an optional CLI flag that runs the PDF extraction with at least 3 different libraries (pdfminer.six, pdfplumber, and one more of your choice). Then based on the extraction result the tool will intelligently choose the best extraction to continue with.
- Summarize the paper using an Anthropic LLM. The summary should about one to two paragraphs at most (about the size of an abstract). It should be written in such language that someone who casually follows the field can understand it.
- Run eval-recipes' (https://github.com/microsoft/eval-recipes) claim verification low level API on the summary to check for unverified claims. An openai key is already an environment variable.
  - Make sure to set the parallelism such that it can finish within 15 minutes (5+ threads).
- If claims are unverified, revise the summary to remove them and use this update as the new summary.
- Save the final summary to {paper_title}_summary.md
- Save verification results to {paper_title}_verification.md with clear formatting

Include a README with usage instructions.
