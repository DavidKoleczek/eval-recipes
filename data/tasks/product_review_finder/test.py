# Define Semantic Test 1: Check Multi-Stage Architecture

STEPS_1_ARCHITECTURE = """1. Explore the code for the product review tool to understand the architecture.
2. Check for required dependencies:
   - Look for dependency files (pyproject.toml, requirements.txt, etc.)
   - Verify the code uses Claude Code or Agent SDK (claude-code-sdk or claude-agent-sdk) for LLM interactions
   - Verify the code uses ddgs (Dux Distributed Global Search) for finding reviews
   - Check that these dependencies are actually imported and used in the code
3. Look for evidence of the required multi-stage pipeline:
   - A writer component that creates the initial draft
   - An accuracy-reviewer that checks for proper citations and hallucinations
   - A completeness-reviewer that checks for all required sections
   - A synthesis-reviewer that checks for coherent analysis
4. Check if the code has logic for:
   - Passing drafts between components with feedback
   - Looping back to writer when reviewers find issues
   - Re-running all previous reviewers after writer makes changes
5. Check if there's support for user feedback with [bracket-enclosed-comments]."""

# Define Semantic Test 2: Run Tool and Validate CLI + Output

STEPS_2_RUN_AND_VALIDATE = """1. Find the README in the project directory that explains how to use the tool.
2. Based on the README, determine the correct command to run the tool with a simple test product like "ROG Xbox Ally X".
3. If the README mentions the --category flag, optionally test with --category "handheld game console".
4. Run the tool. This may take up to 15 minutes as it needs to search the web and go through multiple review stages.
   - If the tool fails or times out, note an overall score of 0 for this test!
5. Verify the CLI interface:
   - Tool accepts a product name as input
   - Tool runs without crashing or errors
   - Tool provides clear output or progress messages
   - Tool completes successfully
6. Find the generated markdown output file:
   - Should be timestamped and named after the product
   - Should be a valid markdown file (.md extension)
7. Examine the markdown report structure - check if it includes:
   - Overall consensus on product quality
   - Key strengths section
   - Key weaknesses section
   - Ratings or scores from reviews
   - Direct quotes from sources
   - Citations with URLs
   - A final recommendation
8. Verify citations are present and properly formatted with URLs."""
