# Define Semantic Test 1: CLI Functionality and PowerPoint Generation

STEPS_1_CLI_AND_GENERATION = """1. Find the README that the agent should have created to understand how to use the tool.
2. Verify the README contains:
   - Installation/setup instructions
   - Command examples for building presentations
   - Examples of using themes
   - Clear usage documentation
3. Test basic conversion:
   - Use the simple_pitch.md test file from the data/ directory
   - Run the tool to convert it to PowerPoint
   - Verify a .pptx file is created
4. Test with theme option:
   - Use any of the test markdown files
   - Try converting with a theme option (if available per the instructions)
   - Verify it runs without errors
5. Validate the tool handles the markdown structure:
   - Slides separated by `---`
   - Headers with `#` become slide titles
   - Bullet points and content are preserved
6. Check error handling:
   - Try running with invalid inputs
   - Verify the tool provides helpful error messages"""

# Define Semantic Test 2: PowerPoint Editability and Structure

STEPS_2_EDITABILITY_VALIDATION = """1. Convert one research_presentation.md from the data/ directory to PowerPoint using the tool.
2. Open and examine the generated .pptx file structure:
   - Use python-pptx library or similar to inspect the file programmatically
   - Check slide count matches markdown structure (count the --- separators)
   - Verify slides have proper titles from # headers
3. Validate editability requirements (THIS IS THE CRITICAL REQUIREMENT):
   - CRITICAL: Check if text is in editable placeholders/text frames (not absolute positioned text boxes)
   - Verify the PowerPoint uses proper slide layouts with placeholders
   - Ensure text boxes are NOT using absolute positioning that prevents editing
   - Check that content follows PowerPoint best practices for editability
   - The instructions specifically say "Use whatever PowerPoint has built-in for making editable text areas"
4. Examine slide content preservation:
   - Bullet points preserved as PowerPoint bullet lists
   - Tables (if any) converted appropriately
   - Text formatting maintained where possible
5. Test editability practically:
   - Can you conceptually move text elements around?
   - Would a non-technical person be able to edit this like a normal PowerPoint?"""
