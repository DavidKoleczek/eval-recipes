I've been writing my presentation decks in markdown because it's so much faster than clicking around in PowerPoint, but I need to get them into PowerPoint format to share with my team and for final review. The problem is every markdown-to-slides tool I've tried creates presentations that are a nightmare to edit in PowerPoint - everything is locked down with absolute positioning and you can't move anything without breaking the whole layout.

I need a command-line tool that converts markdown slide decks into PowerPoint files that are actually editable. Here's what I mean:

My markdown files are structured with slides separated by `---` and I use `#` for slide titles. The tool needs to understand this structure and convert it into proper PowerPoint slides.

The key requirement is that the PowerPoint files need to be editable by non-technical people. When someone opens the presentation in PowerPoint, they should be able to click on text and move it around like any normal PowerPoint slide. I've seen tools that just dump text boxes with fixed positions and it's terrible - don't do that. Use whatever PowerPoint has built-in for making editable text areas.

I'd also like to be able to use different visual themes. Maybe include a few professional-looking ones to start, and let me provide my own PowerPoint template if I have one. Bonus points if I can extract a theme from an existing PowerPoint file.

For the commands, something straightforward like:
- Convert a markdown file to PowerPoint: `ppt-builder build my-deck.md --output presentation.pptx`
- Use a specific theme: `ppt-builder build my-deck.md --theme corporate --output presentation.pptx`

My workflow would be: write and update content in markdown, generate the PowerPoint file whenever I need it, then my team can polish it in PowerPoint - adjust layouts, add images, tweak colors, etc. The markdown stays as the source of truth for the content.

I don't need animations, transitions, or anything fancy - just clean slides that work well in PowerPoint.

Please include a README with clear examples of how to use it. Thanks!
