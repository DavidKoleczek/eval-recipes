I want to create an image tagging system that uses a small vision language model to index a folder of images and output the result to a csv file.
The csv file should have a mapping of the file path, file name, and tags.
You must use Ollama and the local model `gemma3:4b-it-q4_K_M`
Make it a python script that I can run, be sure to explain how to use it.
Make sure when setting up the prompt you give examples for how tags should be extracted from the images since this is a very small model.
