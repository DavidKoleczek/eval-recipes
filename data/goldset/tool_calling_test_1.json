PLA (Polylactic Acid): Made from corn starch, sugarcane\n   - Pros: Commercially viable, good clarity, compostable\n   - Cons: Limited heat resistance, requires industrial composting\n\n2. PHA (Polyhydroxyalkanoates): Produced by microorganisms\n   - Pros: Marine biodegradable, versatile properties\n   - Cons: Higher cost ($4-5 per kg), limited production capacity\n\n3. Starch-based plastics: Blend of starch and other biodegradable polymers\n   - Pros: Low cost, home compostable\n   - Cons: Poor moisture resistance, limited applications\n\n**Regulatory Landscape:**\n- EU Single-Use Plastics Directive banning certain plastic products\n- California and other US states implementing Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) laws\n- China's plastic pollution control policy driving demand for alternatives\n\n**Market Leaders:**\n- NatureWorks (USA) - largest PLA producer\n- Novamont (Italy) - starch-based bioplastics\n- BASF (Germany) - ecoflex® biodegradable plastics\n- Danimer Scientific (USA) - PHA production"
