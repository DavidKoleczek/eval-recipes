      "content": "When implementing a distributed cache for microservices, you need to consider consistency models, eviction policies, and network partitioning. According to the Redis documentation and Martin Kleppmann's \"Designing Data-Intensive Applications\" (O'Reilly, 2017), the CAP theorem fundamentally constrains your choices - you must balance consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. Most distributed caches like Redis or Hazelcast choose AP (availability and partition tolerance) over strong consistency.\n\nCache invalidation strategy is critical. Facebook's engineering blog describes their use of cache-aside pattern with TTL-based expiration combined with event-driven invalidation for critical data. Consider implementing circuit breakers as described in Michael Nygard's \"Release It!\" to handle cache failures gracefully without cascading failures across services.\n\nFor data serialization, Protocol Buffers or MessagePack offer better performance than JSON according to benchmarks from the Google Developer Documentation. Network topology matters too - colocating cache nodes with service instances reduces latency but increases infrastructure complexity as noted in AWS's ElastiCache best practices guide."

      "content": "Cache monitoring requires tracking hit rates, latency percentiles, and eviction patterns. Brendan Gregg's \"Systems Performance\" (Pearson, 2020) identifies cache hit ratio as the primary metric, with industry standards suggesting maintaining above 80% for read-heavy workloads. Track p50, p95, and p99 latencies separately for hits and misses as recommended in Google's SRE book.\n\nDatadog's monitoring best practices guide emphasizes tracking memory usage patterns and eviction rates to prevent cache thrashing. Monitor connection pool utilization - Redis documentation recommends keeping active connections below 80% of the configured maximum. Set up alerts for cache stampedes using rate-of-change metrics on cache misses as described in the Varnish Cache documentation.\n\nImplement distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry standards to correlate cache performance with overall request latency. Twitter's engineering blog details how they use cache warmup metrics during deployments to ensure performance stability. Track key distribution using cardinality metrics to identify hot keys that might need special handling through read replicas or local caching layers."

      "content": "Redis and Memcached have distinct trade-offs for distributed caching. According to the official Redis documentation and Memcached's architecture guide, Redis offers richer data structures (lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes) while Memcached focuses solely on key-value storage with superior multi-threaded performance.\n\nMemcached excels at simple caching with lower memory overhead per key - Facebook's engineering blog reports 10-15% less memory usage compared to Redis for pure key-value workloads. Its multi-threaded architecture handles high concurrency better on multi-core systems as demonstrated in ScyllaDB's benchmark showing 1.2 million ops/second on 8 cores versus Redis's single-threaded limit around 100-200k ops/second per instance.\n\nRedis provides persistence options (RDB snapshots, AOF logs) and built-in replication as detailed in \"Redis in Action\" by Josiah Carlson (Manning, 2013). Its support for atomic operations, transactions, and Lua scripting enables complex caching patterns impossible with Memcached. Twitter's engineering posts describe using Redis sorted sets for real-time leaderboards and trending topics, use cases where Memcached would require additional application logic.\n\nThe AWS ElastiCache documentation recommends Memcached for simple caching with consistent hashing for horizontal scaling, while Redis suits applications needing data persistence, pub/sub capabilities, or complex data manipulation at the cache layer."

      "content": "Consistent hashing solves the rehashing problem when cache nodes are added or removed from a distributed system ðŸ”„ According to the original Karger et al. paper from MIT (1997) and explained in detail in \"Designing Data-Intensive Applications\", it maps both cache nodes and keys to points on a virtual ring using a hash function, typically MD5 or SHA-1.\n\nHere's how it works: Each cache node is assigned multiple points on the ring (virtual nodes) to ensure even distribution. When looking up a key, you hash it to find its position on the ring, then traverse clockwise to find the first cache node - that's where the data belongs! ðŸ’« Amazon's Dynamo paper describes using 100-200 virtual nodes per physical node for optimal load distribution.\n\nThe key advantage is minimal data movement when topology changes. Discord's engineering blog shows that adding or removing a node only affects keys between that node and its immediate predecessor on the ring, roughly K/N keys where K is total keys and N is node count. Without consistent hashing, simple modulo hashing (hash(key) % N) would redistribute nearly all keys when N changes! ðŸ˜±\n\nLibraries like libketama (used by Memcached) and Redis Cluster implement this with optimizations. GitHub's infrastructure team reports using jump consistent hashing, reducing their cache miss rate by 5% during scaling operations. The technique ensures that your cache layer can scale smoothly without cascade failures!"
