      Mixed adherence test case:
      - Follows: citation of sources (consistently), conciseness (mostly), professional tone (mostly)
      - Violates: no emojis (uses emojis in responses 3 and 5), paragraph form (sometimes)
      - Total preferences: ~6 (concise, no emojis, cite sources, authoritative sources, paragraph form, professional tone)
      - Expected adherence: ~3-4 out of 6 preferences followed
      The assistant starts strong but degrades in following preferences over the conversation.

    notes: |
      When no tools are provided, the evaluation should be marked as not applicable.

      User preferences from form_data:
      - Always cite sources (followed in final response with search results)
      - Always be factual and accurate (well followed throughout)
      - Keep responses concise (partially followed - responses are informative but lengthy)
      - Prefer paragraph form responses (mixed - uses both paragraphs and bullet points)
      - Use official/authoritative sources (followed when using search results)
      Assistant preferences: Bounce Performance, Durability - both addressed thoroughly
      Overall: Good adherence to most preferences, some deviation on conciseness and format
