Look at the currently staged files and check for and fix any issues around the following:
- Spelling, grammar, and formatting
- Make sure that imports in any pyproject.toml files are organized alphabetically.
- Comments are only added when they capture intent that cannot be encoded in names, types, or structure.
  - Reserve comments for the "why". Use them to record rationale, trade-offs, links to specs/papers, or non-obvious domain insightsâ€”things not obvious from the code itself. Comments should add signal that code can't.
